Scrumban


Scrumban can be used for long-term projects that require ongoing maintenance.
	
Just like Scrum, Scrumban works in small iterations of 2 weeks and visualizes the entire project on a Scrumban board, which is similar to a Kanban board but gives you more information and freedom. From the Kanban system, this methodology takes the concepts of pulling work, limiting WIP, and continuous operations.
Principles
Improve Workflow Visualization – visualize every work activity/stage that an item goes through.
Limit Work In Progress – limit how much work teams can have in every single work stage.
Manage Flow – introduce flow principles inside iterations.
Make Process Policies Explicit – create and visualize work policies that communicate the needs of the process.
Implement Feedback Loops – analyze flow data as part of appropriate Scrum ceremonies (ex. Retrospectives).
Improve Collaboratively – test and evolve your working practices constantly to discover the best fit for your unique process.

Topics:
Queues - how many and what purpose?
Planning
Prioritization
Work In Progress - what limit?
How to encourage teamwork?
Sprint length - 2 weeks, 1 week?
Demo, retrospective, daily?
Lack of predictability?
Less control ? (pull based approach)
Metrics:
Cycle Time: The amount of elapsed time between when a work item starts and when a work item finishes. 
Work Item Age: The amount of time between when a work item started and the current time. This applies only to items that are still in progress. 
Throughput: The number of work items finished per unit of time

From Nasko:
1. What is the feedback of the team after adopting Scrum?
2. Why are team members not proactive?




Questions:
When developer can not pull top priority ticket - from TODO column - team should decide if dev can get second or third ticket - but encourage little training/support so dev is capable of getting top priority ticket - https://youtu.be/CiNuIK_B5i4?t=327
